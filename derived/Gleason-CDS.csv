"gleason","Rachi and I went in"
"gleason","and you push a a lever like a little button on the side"
"gleason","something you push down"
"gleason","I think to the right"
"gleason","and the curtains close behind you so only you are inside"
"gleason","and nobody can see what you're voting"
"gleason","remember"
"gleason","and then you push down the little levers"
"gleason","like one says Carter and one says"
"gleason","Ford"
"gleason","Senate"
"gleason","Neelea"

"gleason","only paper ballot can"
"gleason","and that's what happened"
"gleason","what"
"gleason","yeah here's"
"gleason","then the the machine wouldn't work"
"gleason","when you tried to press it off on at the very end of all your voting you have_to press one pin to make the machine click"

"gleason","but if you"
"gleason","the voting"
"gleason","the polling"
"gleason","oh this"
"gleason","uh meat and rice"

"gleason","my arches hurt"
"gleason","that's that's the one thing"
"gleason","she"
"gleason","that's right"
"gleason","well Betty Hossefatt in Ron's told me that there's a store in Cambridge called the Run_a_thon"
"gleason","it sells excellent shoes for joggers"
"gleason","b that I am walking briskly on A_M aerobics program I was thinking of going there"
"gleason","mhm"
"gleason","think"
"gleason","got an estimate from Norstrom"
"gleason","one thousand dollars if we do the work three"
"gleason","if he the work"
"gleason","no"
"gleason","he was just very quiet"
"gleason","I"
"gleason","yeah right"
"gleason","I think Bob Higgens is gonna get our"
"gleason","no"
"gleason","no he sent me it in the mail"
"gleason","try this"
"gleason","it was very well written up though"
"gleason","xxx I'm sorry"
"gleason","have another one"
"gleason","no but he came in a suit and a tie"
"gleason","very quiet didn't"
"gleason","Sherman"
"gleason","and I haven't gotten his yet"
"gleason","but I imagine his is going to be comparable"
"gleason","I just have this feeling"
"gleason","I don't know Bob Higgens seems to be more in our price range"
"gleason","yeah"
"gleason","what"
"gleason","think I'm going to get the job"
"gleason","well I mean if Sherman comes up with a two thousand for him to do all the work I think Bob Higgens is gonna get the job yeah"
"gleason","I mean that's one"
"gleason","yeah well I I'm sure that will increase it you know somewhat but"
"gleason","no ten"
"gleason","ten or eleven"
"gleason","Rand"
"gleason","mu"
"gleason","oh yeah"
"gleason","know why"
"gleason","cause you got some on your mouth and then it"
"gleason","mhm"
"gleason","Norstrom and Sherman came the same day"
"gleason","oughta"
"gleason","oughta get Sherman's tomorrow"
"gleason","he's the highest so far"
"gleason","there was another"
"gleason","yes he is the highest so far because Billy England uh was my first one and he was the highest"
"gleason","for him to do just the preparation cause I never asked him if he would do everything"
"gleason","his was only"
"gleason","his was"
"gleason","I mean like maybe four hundred or five hundred"
"gleason","and that was the highest for preparation but um"
"gleason","no I don't know what the rule of thumb is because I didn't ask them all that question"
"gleason","because it wasn't until I was half way through talking to these people that you decided that you decided that maybe it would be worth us asking them"
"gleason","the last four"
"gleason","yeah"
"gleason","da last four two doubled it and one only gave me an estimate for when he did all the work"
"gleason","and you never gave anything back from that called called up and you answered"
"gleason","see that's why it would've been nice if you'd taken me seriously when I first started talking"
"gleason","otherwise I could've had twelve estimates"
"gleason","that's cause I don't think that you got really into it"
"gleason","I wish you'd gotten into it at the time when I started discussing it"
"gleason","I think I made too much here"
"gleason","we're not going to be eating all of this"
"gleason","well you eat as much as you can"
"gleason","this nice"
"gleason","you can go to nursery school tomorrow"
"gleason","I thought we wouldn't be able to"
"gleason","why"
"gleason","because we're not going to leave for New Jersey until after nursery school's over"
"gleason","cause Daddy has some work until then"
"gleason","you can put up you can go and visit your auntie again and all those pretty clothes"
"gleason","when you get dressed up when you're over there"
"gleason","you'd like me to stay there for a little bit"
"gleason","you want me to be your auntie"
"gleason","okay I I'll stay a little bit"
"gleason","I'd like to walk too though"

"gleason","um"
"gleason","petals"
"gleason","mm"
"gleason","why does a flower xxx"
"gleason","I think that this is supposed to be where the pollen is"
"gleason","and the petals are pretty colors that attract bees so they'll come and make the honey"
"gleason","well that's not a real flower"
"gleason","so they can't"
"gleason","because there's no nectar in a pretend flower"
"gleason","only in real flowers"
"gleason","well cause that's just made out of straw or something"
"gleason","it's not"
"gleason","pollen and nectar"
"gleason","listen we just read a book yesterday about bees making honey"
"gleason","mhm"

"gleason","the queen bees she"
"gleason","only the queen bee lays eggs"
